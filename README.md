# CustomerSegmentation_KMeans_Clustering





This project focuses on customer segmentation for a grocery firm using unsupervised clustering techniques to analyze customer purchasing patterns and segment them based on similar traits. The segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies and product offerings, aiming to meet the diverse needs of various customer types.

### Data Preparation: 
I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing steps, including label encoding, feature scaling, and subsetting the data for dimensionality reduction.
### Dimensionality Reduction:
I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and improve clustering efficiency.
### Clustering:
Using the Elbow Method, I determined the optimal number of clusters and performed clustering with Agglomerative Clustering.
### Cluster Analysis and Profiling:
I analyzed and visualized clusters to understand customer segments. By profiling customers based on personal attributes such as family structure and income/spending habits, I identified high-value customers and those needing focused marketing efforts.

## Key Outcomes
This analysis resulted in four customer clusters, each with unique purchasing behaviors and demographic traits. These insights can help the grocery firm develop more personalized marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize product offerings to better cater to customer needs.
